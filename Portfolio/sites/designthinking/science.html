    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span style="color: aqua" class="w3-tag w3-wide">THE REASON</span></h5>
    <p class="w3-center">Modern research into schizophrenia has pointed to different types of genetic defects in the brain’s primary nerve cells (neurons), but the new research shows that one major cause is defects in the support cells – the glial cells. It is the task of the glial cells to ensure and coordinate the synaptic communication between the nerve cells, so that their dysfunction in schizophrenia can result in miscommunication among neurons.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-center">Glial cells are  known as the "supporting cells" of the nervous system. The four main functions of glial cells are: to surround neurons and hold them in place, to supply nutrients and oxygen to neurons, to insulate one neuron from another, and to destroy and remove the carcasses of dead neurons.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-center">Scientists believe that many different genes may increase the risk of schizophrenia, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself. It is not yet possible to use genetic information to predict who will develop schizophrenia.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-center">The research is based on tests where glial cells – produced from progenitor cells from patients suffering from schizophrenia – have been incorporated into mouse brains. This revolutionary type of model is called a chimera (concept of Greek origin) because it combines human cells with those of mice. In practical terms, scientists have thus succeeded in creating a type of human brain network in living mice.

    <div id="Eat" class="w3-container w3-padding-48 w3-card">
      <h5 class="w3-text-amber">Don't use street drugs, and moderate any use of alcohol</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>Street drugs have chemicals in them that are harmful to the teen brain. Significant alcohol consumption has also been shown to cause brain damage and potentially increased risk of psychosis and likely also schizophrenia. Moreover, a significant amount of research indicates that drugs and alcohol are even more risky (more likely to cause serious brain damage) for people who have a history of mental illness in their family. It is also notable that alcohol abuse is a stronger predictor of psychotic symptoms than regular cannabis use (by a factor of four)(source).</i></p><br>
    
      <h5 class="w3-text-amber">Make an ongoing effort to develop your social skills as much as you can </h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i> If you have any tendencies towards shyness - make an extra effort to learn about social skills as is covered in the books listed below. Social skills are like any other skills; something that we all must learn about and practice to improve. Some parents are not very good at teaching social skills and so frequently children and young adults must make their own efforts to learn them. The area of "emotional intelligence" is a closely related area that researchers suggested is an important to enhance our knowledge and skills in.</i></p><br>
    
      <h5 class="w3-text-amber">Avoid social isolation</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>Don't spend too much time alone - try to get out and enjoy time with your friends every day or two, at least. If you go to college, live with roommates that you get along well with, don’t get too isolated.</i></p><br>
    
      <h5 class="w3-text-amber">Make an extra effort to learn positive perspectives on the world and situations you encounter.</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>Make sure you understand that setbacks or problems you encounter in life are opportunities for growth and merely part of a normal life and a valuable learning experience. Problems or difficulties are not a statement or judgement about you personally - but simply an indication that you hadn't learned how to solve that given problem yet. With time and effort most problems can be understood and resolved.</i></p><br>
    
      <h5 class="w3-text-amber">Make extra effort to learn how to deal with stress and anxiety</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey"><i>When you do feel stress, depression or sadness, fear or anxiety (high levels of worry, fear, or perfectionism) – discuss the issues with close friends or family members, and read the books listed below to learn the skills that will allow you to reduce the worries, fear and anxiety so as to have a positive outlook on life. Also, be sure to get regular excercise (30 minutes of vigorous excercise three to five times a week). years or earlier. It is extremely rare, with an incidence of less than 0.04 percent.</i></p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span style="color: aqua" class="w3-tag w3-wide ">WHAT IS CRISPR</span></h5>
    <p class="w3-center">CRISPR technology is a simple yet powerful tool for editing genomes. It allows researchers to easily alter DNA sequences and modify gene function. Its many potential applications include correcting genetic defects, treating and preventing the spread of diseases and improving crops. 
    </p>
    <p class="w3-center">More recently, this technology has been increasingly applied to the study or treatment of human diseases, including Barth syndrome effects on the heart, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, Bipolar Disorder, and Schizophrenia.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-center">Scientists and other experts think that it is entirely possible to live in a society where genetic disorders are a thing of the past. However, its promise also raises ethical concerns.
